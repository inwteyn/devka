  array('blog_id'=>'1','title'=>'Competitions','body'=>'<p>Drifting competitions are judged based on line, angle, speed, show factor and proximity. Line involves taking the correct line, which is usually announced beforehand by judges. The show factor is based on multiple things, such as the amount of smoke, how close the car is to the wall or designated clipping point, and the crowd\'s reaction. Angle is the angle of a car and more importantly the turned wheels in a drift, speed is the speed entering a turn, the speed through a turn, and the speed exiting the turn; faster is better.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>The judging takes place on just a small part of&nbsp; the circuit, a few linking corners that provide good viewing, and opportunities for drifting. The rest of the circuit is irrelevant, except as it pertains to controlling the temperature of the tires and setting the car up for the first judged corner. In the tandem passes, the lead driver often feints his or her entry to the first corner to upset the chase driver, however in some European series, this practice is frowned upon by judges and considered foul play, resulting in deduction of points.There are typically two sessions, a qualifying/practice session, and a final session. In the qualifying sessions, referred as&nbsp;Tansō&nbsp;(単走:solo run), drifters get individual passes in front of judges (who may or may not be the final judges) to try to make the final 16. This is often on the day preceding the final.</p>
<p>The finals are tandem passes, referred as&nbsp;Tsuisō&nbsp;(追走:chasing race). Drivers are paired off, and each heat comprises two passes, with each driver taking a turn to lead. The best of the 8 heats go to the next 4, to the next 2, to the final. The passes are judged as explained above, however there are some provisos such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Overtaking the lead car under drift conditions is ok if you don\'t interrupt the lead car\'s drift.</li>
<li>Overtaking the lead car under grip conditions automatically forfeits that pass.</li>
<li>Spinning forfeits that pass, unless the other driver also spins.</li>
<li>Increasing the lead under drift conditions helps to win that pass.</li>
<li>Maintaining a close gap while chasing under drift conditions helps to win that pass.</li>

  array('blog_id'=>'6','title'=>'Dream team','body'=>'<p>In 1988, Johan Cruyff returned to the club as manager and he assembled the so-called Dream Team. He used a mix of Spanish players like Pep Guardiola, Jos&eacute; Mari Bakero, and Txiki Begiristain while signing international stars such as Ronald Koeman, Michael Laudrup, Rom&aacute;rio, and Hristo Stoichkov. Under his guidance, Barcelona won four consecutive La Liga titles from 1991 to 1994. They beat Sampdoria in both the 1989 Cup Winners\' Cup final and the 1992 European Cup final at Wembley. They also won a Copa del Rey in 1990, the European Super Cup in 1992, and three Supercopa de Espa&ntilde;a. With 11 trophies, Cruyff became the club\'s most successful manager, until being overtaken by Guardiola in 2011. He also became the club\'s longest consecutive serving manager, serving 8 years. Cruyff\'s fortune changed in his final two seasons, when he failed to win any trophies and fell out with president N&uacute;&ntilde;ez, resulting in his departure.</p>
<p>Cruyff was briefly replaced by Bobby Robson, who took charge of the club for a single season in 1996&ndash;97. The club signed Ronaldo and delivered a cup treble, winning the Copa del Rey, Cup Winners Cup, and the Supercopa de Espa&ntilde;a. Despite his success Robson was only ever seen as a short-term solution while the club waited for Louis van Gaal to become available. The club won the UEFA Super Cup against Borussia Dortmund and won a Copa del Rey and La Liga double in 1998. In 1999 the club celebrated its \'centenari\', winning the Primera Divisi&oacute;n title. Rivaldo became the fourth Bar&ccedil;a player to be awarded European Footballer of the Year. Despite this domestic success, the failure to extend that success to the Champions League led to van Gaal and N&uacute;&ntilde;ez resigning in 2000.</p>','owner_id'=>'3','creation_date'=>'2013-01-25 11:25:56','modified_date'=>'2013-01-25 11:25:56','view_count'=>'1','comment_count'=>'0','owner_type'=>'user','category_id'=>'1','search'=>'1','draft'=>'0'),
  array('blog_id'=>'7','title'=>'El Clásico','body'=>'<p>There is often a fierce rivalry between the two strongest teams in a national league, and this is particularly the case in La Liga, where the game between Bar&ccedil;a and Real Madrid is known as El Cl&aacute;sico. From the start of national competitions the clubs were seen as representatives of two rival regions in Spain: Catalonia and Castile, as well as of the two cities. The rivalry reflects what many regard as the political and cultural tensions felt between Catalans and the Castilians, seen by one author as a re-enactment of the Spanish Civil War.</p>
<p>During the dictatorships of Primo de Rivera and especially of Francisco Franco (1939&ndash;1975), all regional cultures were suppressed. All of the languages spoken in Spanish territory, except Spanish (Castilian) itself, were officially banned. Symbolising the Catalan people\'s desire for freedom, Bar&ccedil;a became \'More than a club\' (M&eacute;s que un club) for the Catalans. According to Manuel V&aacute;zquez Montalb&aacute;n, the best way for the Catalans to demonstrate their identity was by joining Bar&ccedil;a. It was less risky than joining a clandestine anti-Franco movement, and allowed them to express their dissidence.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Real Madrid was widely seen as the embodiment of the sovereign oppressive centralism and the fascist regime at management level and beyond (Santiago Bernabeu, the former club president for whom the Merengues stadium is named, fought with los nacionales). However, during the Spanish Civil War, members of both clubs such as Josep Sunyol and Rafael S&aacute;nchez Guerra suffered at the hands of Franco supporters.</p>
<p>During the 1950s the rivalry was exacerbated further when there was a controversy surrounding the transfer of Alfredo di St&eacute;fano, who finally played for Real Madrid and was key to their subsequent success. The 1960s saw the rivalry reach the European stage when they met twice at the knock-out rounds of the European Cup.</p>','owner_id'=>'3','creation_date'=>'2013-01-25 11:27:35','modified_date'=>'2013-01-25 11:27:35','view_count'=>'2','comment_count'=>'0','owner_type'=>'user','category_id'=>'1','search'=>'1','draft'=>'0'),
  array('blog_id'=>'8','title'=>'Operating system','body'=>'<p>he iPhone 5 features iOS, Apple\'s mobile operating system. The user interface of iOS is based on the concept of direct manipulation, using multi-touch gestures. Interface control elements consist of sliders, switches, and buttons. Interaction with the OS includes gestures such as swipe, tap, pinch, and reverse pinch, all of which have specific definitions within the context of the iOS operating system and its multi-touch interface. Internal accelerometers are used by some applications to respond to shaking the device (one common result is the undo command) or rotating it vertically (one common result is switching from portrait to landscape mode).</p>
<p>The iPhone 5 can play music, movies, television shows, ebooks, audiobooks, and podcasts and can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, playlists, genres, composers, podcasts, audiobooks, and compilations. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from iTunes. Users can rotate their device horizontally to landscape mode to access Cover Flow. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the 5, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a Genius playlist.</p>
<p>Like the iPhone 4S, the iPhone 5 has Siri, that allows the user to operate the iPhone by spoken commands. The software was improved in iOS 6 to include the ability to make restaurant reservations, launch apps, dictate Facebook or Twitter updates, retrieve movie reviews and detailed sports statistics.</p>
<p>iOS 6 features several new and/or updated apps, which includes Apple Maps and Passbook. Apple\'s built-in Maps app, which replaced the former Maps app powered by Google Maps, has been universally derided and lacks many features present in competing maps apps. It is also known to give inaccurate directions. It uses Apple&rsquo;s new vector-based engine that eliminates lag, making for smoother zooming. New to Maps is turn-by-turn navigation spoken directions, 3D views in some major cities and real-time traffic. iOS 6 is able to retrieve documents such as boarding passes, admission tickets, coupons and loyalty cards through its new Passbook app. An iOS device with Passbook can be scanned under a reader to process a mobile payment at locations that have compatible hardware. The app has context-aware features such as notifications for relevant coupons when in the immediate vicinity of a given store.</p>
<p>Facebook comes integrated through Apple&rsquo;s native apps with iOS 6. Facebook features can be directly accessed from within native apps such as Calendar which can sync Facebook events, or use Facebook&rsquo;s like button from within the Apple App Store.</p>','owner_id'=>'7','creation_date'=>'2013-01-26 04:58:26','modified_date'=>'2013-01-26 04:58:26','view_count'=>'0','comment_count'=>'0','owner_type'=>'user','category_id'=>'1','search'=>'1','draft'=>'0'),
  array('blog_id'=>'9','title'=>'Hardware','body'=>'<p>The iPhone 5 uses a system on chip (SoC), called the Apple A6. The SoC comprises a 1.3 GHz dual-core processor, 1GB of RAM and a tri-core PowerVR SGX543MP4 running at 266 MHz. The iPhone 5\'s operating memory (LPDDR2-1066 eDRAM) was doubled, from 512 MB to 1 GB. Storage capacities available are fixed at 16, 32 or 64 GB, the same as the 4S; plug-in memory cards are not supported. The two color options are black (with black glass and slate-colored metal trim), and white (with white ceramic and silver-colored metal trim); again the same color options (though differently implemented) as its predecessor the 4S had. The iPhone 5 retains the 8 MP back camera on the iPhone 4S, but has improved low-light performance, and has a 40% faster photo capture than its predecessors, while having a purple hue when a strong source of light is present in the photograph. The front camera, which is accessible through the FaceTime and camera app has a lower resolution, at 1.2 megapixels. The rechargeable lithium-ion polymer battery with a charge capacity of 1440mAh is built in and cannot be replaced by the user; it is rated at &le;225 hours of standby time and &le;8 hours of talk time. There are three separate models of the phone available: one supporting CDMA and two GSM versions. This can have knock-on effects for which version of the device will actually work in which countries/regions.[citation needed] The phone takes a nano-SIM, smaller than the micro-SIM of the iPhone 4 and iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>Hardware benchmarking conducted using Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and mentioned at the unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 times higher than the iPhone 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 times better than the iPhone 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 times better than the iPhone 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4S.</p>
<p>The display is 1,136 &times; 640 pixels with an aspect ratio of almost exactly 16:9, (minus two extra rows of horizontal pixels). With a diagonal of 4" it has a display size of 6.7 square inches, compared to 5.7 in iPhone 4 and 4S. The pixel density remains the same as the 4S model, which is 326 pixels per inch. Now, the matrix icons appear as a column 4 of 6 icons, including those located at the bottom. This gives an extra row of icons on the desktop. In-cell touch sensor technology from Sharp allows the screen to be thinner, allowing for a thinner phone. The screen\'s color saturation is 44% greater than its predecessor.</p>

<p>&nbsp;Learn proper race shifting to get your car into the right gear for drifting. Section also includes double clutch shifting so you can downshift before drifting without blowing out your transmission too quickly.</p>
<p><strong>Power Over Drift</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;A throttle induced drift, this is performed when entering a corner and using the accelerator to slip the rear wheels, producing heavy oversteer through the turn. You will often need lots of horsepower to make this happen.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>E-Brake Drift </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This drifting technique is very basic, pull the E-Brake or side brake to induce rear traction loss and balance drift through steering and throttle play. This can also be used to correct errors or fine tune drift angles. Main drift technique used in FWD vehicles, however since it does decrease speeds, e-brake drifting is looked down upon during solo (tansou) type drifting competition.</p>
<p><strong>Clutch Kick Drift </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;This drifting technique is performed by depressing the clutch pedal on approach or during turn in to a corner. The clutch is "popped" to give a sudden jolt through the driveline to upset rear traction, causing the power wheels to slip. Drifting is maintained by balancing the throttle.</p>','owner_id'=>'8','creation_date'=>'2013-01-26 06:47:06','modified_date'=>'2013-01-26 06:47:06','view_count'=>'4','comment_count'=>'0','owner_type'=>'user','category_id'=>'1','search'=>'1','draft'=>'0'),
